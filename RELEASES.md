Version 0.100.0 (2023-04-09)
============================

New features
------------

- Two new upscaling methods:
  - `Nearest Neighbour`: Uses the closest matching pixel. Looks sharp and pixilated.
  - `Rasterize`: Rasterizes the game at the target resolution. Slightly better pixel selection while still looking relatively sharp. Helps with perspective mode.
- Bilinear filtering when rendering textures. This is requested by the game when rendering most ground textures, but used to be ignored. This is especially helpful in perspective mode when the ground textures get distorted.
- New `bilinear-sharpness` configuration option to control how sharp the filtering of the new bilinear texture filter should be. Higher values will render closer to the old version.
- Display cutscenes using the full size of the window instead of being boxed into a 4x3 area.
- Add `nokeepaspectratio` option to stretch the game to the window.
- Update `SGD2FreeRes` to version `3.0.3.1`. This adds support for `v1.10` and `v1.12a`; and fixes the issue with black tiles appearing around the border of the screen.
- Implement full motion prediction for `v1.10`.
- Implement text motion prediction for `v1.09` and `v1.12`.

Performance
-----------

- Fix the small, but regular frame stutter experienced by some people.
- Fix the frame stutter that occurs at higher frame rates in certain areas. e.g "The River of Flame" and various parts of Act 5.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix text labels jiggling occasionally, especially when there are a large number of them.
- Fix cursor entering the black part of the window in fullscreen mode when cursor locking is enabled.
- Only lock the cursor once the mouse has clicked the window.

- Fix gradual slowdown over time when motion prediction is enabled.
- Fix inaccurately drawn lines.

- Fix low fps in the menus for 1.09d.

Version 0.99.527b

    the Wiki page (<https://github.com/bolrog/d2dx/wiki/Motion-Prediction>) for info on how to enable it.
- Updated: fix some glitches.

Version 0.99.429

- Performance optimizations.

Version 0.99.415
================

- Add fps fix that greatly smoothes out frame pacing and mouse cursor movement. Can be disabled with -dxnofpsfix.
- Improve color precision a bit on devices that support 10 bits per channel (this is not HDR, just reduces precision loss from in-game lighting/gamma).
- To improve bug reports, a log file (d2dx_log.txt) will be written to the Diablo II folder.

Version 0.99.414
================

- The mouse cursor is now confined to the game window by default. Disable with -dxnoclipcursor.
- Finish AA implementation, giving improved quality.
- Reverted behavior: the mouse cursor will now "jump" when opening inventory like in the unmodded game. This avoids the character suddenly changing movement direction if holding LMB while opening the inventory.

- Fix issue where D2DX used the DX 10.1 feature level by default even on better GPUs.

Version 0.99.410
================

- Improved non-integer scaling quality, using "anti-aliased nearest" sampling (similar to sharp-bilinear).
- Specifying -dxnowide will now select a custom screen mode that gives integer scaling, but with ~4:3 aspect ratio.
- Added -dxnoresmod option, which turns off the built-in SlashDiablo-HD (no custom resolutions).
- (For res mod authors) Tuned configurator API to disable the built-in SlashDiablo-HD automatically when used.
- Other internal improvements.

Version 0.99.408
================

- Fix window size being squashed vertically after alt-entering from fullscreen mode.
- Fix crash when running on Windows 7.

Version 0.99.407
================

================

- Fix bug that could crash the game in the Video Options menu.
